# IoT Greenhouse System

This project contains the code for an IoT Greenhouse System. The following instructions will guide you through setting up the device.

## Device Setup

1. **Navigate to the Device directory**: Change your current working directory to the `Device` folder in the terminal.

2. **Create a virtual environment**: We recommend using `virtualenv` to create an isolated environment where you can install the Python dependencies for this project. If you don't have `virtualenv` installed, you can install it with `pip install virtualenv`.

3. **Activate the virtual environment**: Once you've created the virtual environment, you need to activate it. On Windows, use the command `.\venv\Scripts\activate`. On Unix or MacOS, use `source venv/bin/activate`.

4. **Install the project dependencies**: The `requirements.txt` file lists all of the Python packages that this project depends on. You can install them with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

5. **Run the device script**: With the dependencies installed, you can now run the `device.py` script with `python device.py`.

Please ensure you have the necessary permissions to install packages and run scripts on your system.
